### TF2 Optimized Maps Project

    TF2 Optimized Maps Project is a project which attempts to optimize _every_ single Valve made map.
    If you'd like to help out, please contact me on Steam (preferably one of the workshop pages, I don't tend to accept friend requests) or at my email treacherousfiend@proton.me
    
    I'm currently not planning on doing community made maps because a lot more goes into it than just optimizing a Valve made map (contacting the creator, getting permission, potentially getting VMF files, etc.)
